```bash
# Essential dependencies
pip install numpy matplotlib

# Optional but recommended for 3D visualization
pip install open3d

# Optional for advanced analysis
pip install scipy scikit-learn
```

### Running the Tutorials

1. **Start Jupyter**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   # or
   jupyter lab
   ```

2. **Navigate** to the notebooks folder

3. **Open a tutorial** and follow along step-by-step

4. **Modify the device IP** in the connection cells to match your Aurora device

### Device Configuration

Before running the tutorials, ensure your Aurora device is:

- **Powered on** and fully initialized
- **Connected to the same network** as your computer
- **Not being used** by other applications
- **In the correct mode** for the features you want to test

## 📊 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Connection Problems:**
```python
# Check device IP and network
ping 192.168.1.212

# Verify Aurora SDK installation
import slamtec_aurora_sdk
print("SDK imported successfully")
```

**Visualization Issues:**
```python
# For Jupyter display problems
%matplotlib inline

# For Open3D in remote environments
# Use headless mode and save point clouds to files
```

**Performance Issues:**
```python
# Reduce point cloud size
scan_data = sdk.get_recent_lidar_scan(max_points=2048)

# Lower update rates
time.sleep(0.2)  # 5Hz instead of 10Hz
```

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging for troubleshooting:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

# Your Aurora SDK code here
```
